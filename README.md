# Repair at Crafting Bench (Continued)
Allows you to repair weapons and apparel at the same workbenches where they were crafted.

## Description
There have been many different item repair mods released over the years, but none of them have ever felt quite right to me. Repairing buildings is free aside from the time expenditure required, yet every mod introducing item repair has usually involved some type of resource sink.

That's why I was so happy to find the Repair at Crafting Bench mod. Finally you didn't need a specialized repair workbench or a bunch of raw resources in order to restore the durability of your weapons and apparel. Since there is currently no sign that the author is planning to update it for RimWorld 1.6, I've decided to update it myself.

## Features
* Repair weapons and apparel at the same workbenches used to craft them
* New configurable repair bills are added to existing workbenches to give you full control over item repair jobs
* Different repair bills are created to group items by their crafting skill requirements
* Repairing only requires time and doesn't consume any type of crafting resources

## Compatibility
* Should be compatible with just about anything. Mods which add new workbenches or crafting recipes should be handled automatically.
* Likely won't clash with other item repair mods, but why would you do that?
* Safe to add to existing saves. Before attempting removal you should delete any existing repair bills from all workbenches.

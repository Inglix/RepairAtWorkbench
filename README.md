# Repair at Crafting Bench (Continued)
Allows you to repair weapons and apparel at the same workbenches where they were crafted.

## Description
There have been many different item repair mods released over the years, but none of them have ever felt quite right to me. Repairing buildings is free aside from the time expenditure required, yet every mod introducing item repair has usually involved some type of resource sink.

That's why I was so happy to find the Repair at Crafting Bench mod. Finally you didn't need a specialized repair workbench or a bunch of raw resources in order to restore the durability of your weapons and apparel. Since there is currently no sign that the author is planning to update it for RimWorld 1.6, I've decided to update it myself.
